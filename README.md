## Built with 🛠
  - [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org) - First class and official programming language for Android Development.
  - [Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html) - A coroutine is a concurrency design pattern that you can use on Android to simplify code that 
    executes asynchronously. On Andorid, coroutines helps to manage long running tasks that might otherwise block tha main thread and cause your app to become unresponsive.
  - [Android Architecture Compenents](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture) - Collection of libraries that help you design, robust, testable and maintainable 
      apps.
      -[LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata) - Data Objects that notify views when the underlying database changes.
      -[ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) - Stores UI related data that isn't destroyed on UI changes.
      -[ViewBinding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/view-binding) - Generates a binding class for each XML layout file present in the module and 
      allows you to more easily write code that interacts with views.
  - [KOIN](https://insert-koin.io) - Dependecy Injection Framework.
  - [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) - A type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java.
  - [GSON](https://github.com/google/gson) - A Java Serialization/Deserailization library to convert Java Objects into JSON and back. 
  - [GSON Converter](https://github.com/square/retrofit/tree/master/retrofit-converters/gson) - A converter which uses GSON for serialization to and from JSON.
  - [OkHttp3](https://github.com/square/okhttp) -  For implementing interceptor, logging and mocking web server.
  - [Glide](https://github.com/bumptech/glide) - An image loading and caching library for Android focused on smooth scrolling.
